About T177 program:

    The T177 is the program that I am currently enrolled, its full name is Computer
Programming and Analysis (T177), and it’s an advanced diploma program that runs for
three years, which I am currently attending the 5th semester. It gives a lot of
hands-on experience during lab classes, assignments and team projects. At the end
of this course, I am going to be ready to take on roles like software developer,
web programmer, systems analyst, or database developer.
