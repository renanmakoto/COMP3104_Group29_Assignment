-------Information about DevOps-------

    In software development, Devops is one of the best ways to work, it mixes
the people who write the code (developers) and the people who take care of
running the systems (operations). In the past, these two groups often worked
in different parts and times. Developers would finish their code and send to
the operations team, who had to make sure it worked in real life, but it
created delays and miscommunication. DevOps came to solve this problem,
making these two kinds of professional collaborate together with the goal to
deliver software faster, with fewer bugs, and in a more reliable way by
pushing updates in small steps, sometimes even several times a day.
