-------Information about  THE COMP3104 DevOps-------

    COMP3104 has the main focus of introducing students to DevOps concepts, tools,
and practices that are widely used in the software industry today. Students can
understand how development and operations work together. this course offers the
theoretical and practical sides of DevOps, some mai topics talk about Continuous
Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), automation of testing and deployment,
version control with Git and containerization with Docker. With 2  big hands-on
team projects, students can get to work on real-world scenarios where they apply
DevOps principles.

    In software development, Devops is one of the best ways to work, it mixes
the people who write the code (developers) and the people who take care of
running the systems (operations). In the past, these two groups often worked
in different parts and times. Developers would finish their code and send to
the operations team, who had to make sure it worked in real life, but it
created delays and miscommunication. DevOps came to solve this problem,
making these two kinds of professional collaborate together with the goal to
deliver software faster, with fewer bugs, and in a more reliable way by
pushing updates in small steps, sometimes even several times a day.

    Some main practices in DevOps helps teams work better and release software more
efficiently. One of the most important is Continuous Integration and Continuous
Delivery (CI/CD), where developers integrate their code changes into a shared
repository very often and each change is automatically tested, so problems can
be spotted and fixed right away, and Continuous Delivery makes sure those changes
can be deployed into production quickly and safely.

    Another practice is automation, where Instead of doing tasks manually, teams
set up servers, run tests, create builds, and even deploying applications.
Automation reduces human error and makes the whole process faster. Besides that,
monitoring and feedback are also crucial, after a system is deployed, DevOps teams
keep track of how itâ€™s performing using monitoring tools to check if everything
is running smoothly, and if something goes wrong, alerts are triggered right away.
