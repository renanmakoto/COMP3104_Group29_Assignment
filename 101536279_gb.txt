Just over 2,000 students enrolled when George Brown College first opened its doors in 1968.  We used to provide programs in construction, early childhood education, dentistry, and the culinary arts, among other areas that we still teach today. Other programs we offered included signwriting and watchmaking, which may not be as relevant today.  Unbelievably, we even offered a marine engineering degree that prepared students for professions at sea.  Our enrollment of full-time students has increased to almost 30,000 since then.  People from all across the Greater Toronto Area, the nation, and the world come to George Brown to acquire the practical experience and skills necessary to be successful in the workplace.
