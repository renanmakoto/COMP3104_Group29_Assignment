DevOps shortens feedback loops across Plan → Build → Test → Release → Operate → Monitor, improving quality and delivery speed.

- Automated checks on each push (CI)
- Small, frequent merges via PR
- Fast rollback and recovery
- Shared ownership and visibility
- CI: Continuous Integration (automated build/test on push)
- CD: Continuous Delivery/Deployment (automated release pipeline)
- PR: Pull Request (review & merge gate)
