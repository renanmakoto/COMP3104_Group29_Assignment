DevOps is a collection of methods, a way of thinking, and a collection of tools that integrate software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to create software more rapidly and consistently.   By bringing together previously separated teams through collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback, businesses may shorten the software development lifecycle, improve product quality, and better achieve client objectives.   This approach allows teams to continuously provide value throughout the application lifecycle by fostering a culture of shared ownership.
