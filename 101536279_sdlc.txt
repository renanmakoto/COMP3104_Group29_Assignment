Usually comprising stages like planning, analysis, design, development (coding), testing, deployment, and maintenance, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is an organized procedure that directs the creation of high-quality software.  By defining roles and maximizing consistency across the process, it gives teams a foundation for producing software effectively.  Different techniques to handling these phases are offered by the various SDLC models, which include the more contemporary Agile and the more conventional Waterfall.
