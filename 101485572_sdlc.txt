-------Information about DevOps in the software development lifecycle-------

    DevOps is important in the SDLC because it helps teams release software
faster and more reliably while traditional development, that have long delays
on coding and releasing it to users. When DevOps is implemented and changes
are integrated, tested, and deployed in small steps (CI/CD), teams can spot
problems early, fix them quickly, and avoid major failures, meaning that users
get new features and improvements faster. Besides that, the Automated testing
and deployment reduce human error, making releases more predictable.

    Another important aspect of DevOps in SDLC is the improvement of collaboration
and communication, where teams to work together from the start and everyone shares
responsibility for the software, from coding to deployment to monitoring, leading
to fewer conflicts, quicker problem-solving, and a stronger sense of team ownership.
The focus on teamwork in DevOps also extends to testing, security, and quality
assurance teams, creating a smoother development lifecycle where everyone is aligned
toward the same goals.

    In the SDLC, DevOps helps software teams continuously improve and deliver more
value to customers, monitoring applications in real-time and collecting feedback
about what is working, allowing improvements in the next iteration instead of waiting
for a big release cycle. The continuous improvement is what makes DevOps essential,
ensuring that teams can deliver high-quality software efficiently.
