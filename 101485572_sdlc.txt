-------Information about DevOps in the software development lifecycle-------

    DevOps is important in the SDLC because it helps teams release software
faster and more reliably while traditional development, that have long delays
on coding and releasing it to users. When DevOps is implemented and changes
are integrated, tested, and deployed in small steps (CI/CD), teams can spot
problems early, fix them quickly, and avoid major failures, meaning that users
get new features and improvements faster. Besides that, the Automated testing
and deployment reduce human error, making releases more predictable.
